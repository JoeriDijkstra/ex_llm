# Code Cleanup and Refactoring Recommendations

This document outlines several areas in the codebase that have been identified for cleanup, refactoring, and improvement. Addressing these points will enhance the maintainability, robustness, and clarity of the project.

---

## 1. Deprecated Code and One-Off Scripts

These items are obsolete or were intended for a single use and can be removed.

### 1.1. One-Off Migration Script

-   **File:** `scripts/migrate_to_custom_logger.exs`
-   **Analysis:** This is a one-time migration script used to switch from the standard `Logger` to the custom `ExLLM.Infrastructure.Logger`. Its purpose is complete.
-   **Recommendation:** **Delete this script.** Its history is preserved in git, and its presence in the repository can cause confusion for new contributors.

### 1.2. Deprecated Alias Module

-   **File:** `lib/ex_llm/infrastructure/config_provider.ex`
-   **Analysis:** The `ConfigProvider.Default` module is explicitly documented as a backward-compatibility alias for `ConfigProvider.Env`.
-   **Recommendation:**
    -   **Short-term:** Mark the module with `@deprecated "Use ExLLM.Infrastructure.ConfigProvider.Env instead."`.
    -   **Long-term:** Plan to **remove the `Default` module** in the next major version release to finalize the deprecation.

## 2. Outdated and Unreliable Test Logic

This section highlights test code that is outdated, incomplete, or uses patterns that can lead to flaky tests.

### 2.1. Incomplete Test Context Detection

-   **File:** `lib/ex_llm/testing/cache/test_cache_detector.ex`
-   **Analysis:** The function `get_current_test_context` contains a comment indicating that a key part of its logic is broken or was never implemented: `// get_exunit_context always returns :error for now, so skip it`.
-   **Recommendation:** This is technical debt that impacts the reliability of the test infrastructure. **Investigate and fix `get_exunit_context`**. If it cannot be fixed, the comment should be expanded to explain *why* it's skipped.

### 2.2. Potentially Flaky Stream Test Helper

-   **File:** `test/support/shared/provider_integration_test.exs`
-   **Analysis:** The `collect_stream_chunks/2` helper uses a `receive...after` block with a fixed timeout. This is a common source of flaky tests, as it can fail intermittently on slower machines or under heavy CI load.
-   **Recommendation:** **Make the test helper deterministic.** It should wait for a completion signal (like the `:done` atom sent by some providers) rather than relying on a timeout. This will make the streaming tests more reliable.

## 3. Code Consistency and Refactoring Opportunities

These are areas where code could be made more consistent, less redundant, and easier to maintain.

### 3.1. Redundant and Confusing Test Caching Systems

-   **Files:**
    -   `lib/ex_llm/testing/response_cache.ex`
    -   `lib/ex_llm/infrastructure/cache/storage/test_cache.ex`
-   **Analysis:** The project contains two distinct test-caching systems with potentially confusing names and locations. `ResponseCache` acts like a VCR/cassette system for the mock provider, while `TestCache` is a storage backend for caching *live* API calls during tests. The location of `TestCache` inside `lib/ex_llm/infrastructure` is misleading.
-   **Recommendation:** **Clarify the purpose and location of these modules.**
    1.  **Relocate:** Move `lib/ex_llm/infrastructure/cache/storage/test_cache.ex` to a more appropriate location, such as `lib/ex_llm/testing/live_api_cache.ex`.
    2.  **Rename:** Consider renaming the modules to be more descriptive (e.g., `MockResponseRecorder`, `LiveApiCacheStorage`) to make their distinction clear.

### 3.2. Redundant Error Handling Logic

-   **File:** `lib/ex_llm/providers/shared/error_handler.ex`
-   **Analysis:** The same function clause for handling OpenAI-compatible errors is repeated for multiple providers (`:groq`, `:mistral`, `:perplexity`, `:xai`, etc.).
-   **Recommendation:** **Refactor to be more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).** Define a module attribute like `@openai_compatible_providers` and use a single function clause with a `when provider in @openai_compatible_providers` guard to handle all of them.

### 3.3. Inconsistent Model Name Formatting

-   **Files:**
    -   `lib/ex_llm/providers/xai.ex`
    -   `lib/ex_llm/providers/shared/model_utils.ex`
-   **Analysis:** Model name formatting logic is duplicated across modules. The `XAI` provider has its own `format_model_name` function that mixes provider-specific logic with generic string manipulation.
-   **Recommendation:** **Consolidate the logic.** The provider-specific module (`xai.ex`) should handle its unique logic (e.g., removing the `xai/` prefix) and then delegate the common formatting task to the shared utility in `ModelUtils`.

### 3.4. Brittle JSON Deserialization

-   **File:** `lib/ex_llm/providers/gemini/tuning.ex`
-   **Analysis:** The `from_json` functions manually access keys from decoded maps using patterns like `json["meanLoss"]`. This is brittle because if the API response changes a key name, it will silently assign `nil` instead of raising an error, leading to subtle bugs.
-   **Recommendation:** **Make deserialization more robust.** For required fields, use `Map.fetch!/2` instead of `Map.get/2` or direct key access. This ensures that the function will fail loudly and immediately if the API response is missing an expected field.
