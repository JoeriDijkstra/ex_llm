# OpenRouter Provider Test Results

## ✅ OpenRouter Provider Status: MOSTLY WORKING

### ✅ Working Features

1. **Basic Chat**: ✅ WORKING
   - Successfully connects to OpenRouter API
   - Supports multiple models (openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-3-haiku, google/gemini-flash-1.5)
   - Returns proper responses with token usage and cost tracking
   - Cost tracking working: ~$2.85e-6 per simple request

2. **Model Listing**: ✅ WORKING (FIXED)
   - Successfully lists 323 available models from OpenRouter
   - **Issue**: Initially failed because pipeline used OpenAI-specific model filter
   - **Fix**: Created OpenRouter-specific list models plugs that handle the richer OpenRouter model format
   - Now returns models with full metadata: pricing, context windows, capabilities, provider info

3. **Provider Configuration**: ✅ WORKING
   - Correctly detects when OPENROUTER_API_KEY is configured
   - Uses environment variables properly

4. **Direct Provider Streaming**: ✅ WORKING
   - `ExLLM.Providers.OpenRouter.stream_chat/2` works correctly
   - Successfully streams responses from OpenRouter API
   - Chunks are properly parsed and delivered

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **High-Level Streaming API**: ❌ FAILING
   - **Issue**: `ExLLM.stream/4` fails with pipeline error
   - **Error**: RuntimeError in Req adapter expecting different response format
   - **Root Cause**: Pipeline streaming coordinator has adapter compatibility issue
   - **Status**: Direct streaming works, so this is a pipeline infrastructure issue, not OpenRouter-specific

### Files Modified/Created

1. **Added OpenRouter pipeline support**:
   - Added `:openrouter` chat and stream pipelines to `lib/ex_llm/providers.ex`
   - Added `:openrouter` list_models pipeline support

2. **Created OpenRouter-specific list models plugs**:
   - `lib/ex_llm/plugs/providers/openrouter_prepare_list_models_request.ex`
   - `lib/ex_llm/plugs/providers/openrouter_parse_list_models_response.ex`

### OpenRouter-Specific Features Discovered

- **Rich Model Metadata**: OpenRouter provides extensive model information including:
  - Detailed pricing per token type (prompt, completion, image, request)
  - Context windows and max output tokens
  - Supported parameters and capabilities
  - Provider information and architecture details
  - Vision support detection based on input modalities

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Single API access to 323 models from providers like:
  - OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.)
  - Anthropic (claude-3-haiku, claude-3-sonnet, etc.)
  - Google (gemini-flash-1.5, gemini-2.5-pro, etc.)
  - Many others (MiniMax, DeepSeek, Meta Llama, etc.)

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Provider configuration detection
- ✅ Basic chat with multiple models
- ✅ Model listing (323 models found)
- ✅ Cost tracking
- ✅ Direct provider streaming
- ❌ High-level streaming API (pipeline issue)

### Next Steps

1. **Streaming Fix**: Investigate pipeline streaming coordinator compatibility issue
   - The error suggests the Req adapter format expectations are mismatched
   - May need to update streaming coordinator or adapter configuration
   - This appears to be the same issue affecting other providers (LM Studio, Groq)

2. **Testing**: Add comprehensive integration tests for OpenRouter
   - Model listing with rich metadata
   - Multi-provider model access
   - Cost calculation across different providers
   - Vision model support testing

### Summary

OpenRouter provider is **mostly working** with excellent basic chat and model listing functionality. The streaming issue appears to be a broader pipeline infrastructure problem rather than OpenRouter-specific, as direct provider streaming works perfectly.
