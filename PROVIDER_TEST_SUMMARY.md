### ⚠️ Partially Working

#### XAI (X.AI)
- **Issue**: API key exists but has no credits
- **Error**: "Your newly created teams doesn't have any credits yet"
- **Status**: Provider implementation is correct, just needs billing setup
- **Fix**: Purchase credits at https://console.x.ai/

### ❌ Not Available for Testing

#### Perplexity
- **Issue**: No PERPLEXITY_API_KEY in environment
- **Status**: Provider implemented but cannot test without API key

#### Mistral
- **Issue**: No MISTRAL_API_KEY in environment  
- **Status**: Provider implemented but cannot test without API key

## Available API Keys

The following API keys were found in the environment:
- ✅ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY
- ✅ GEMINI_API_KEY
- ✅ GROQ_API_KEY
- ✅ OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- ⚠️ XAI_API_KEY (no credits)
- ❌ PERPLEXITY_API_KEY (missing)
- ❌ MISTRAL_API_KEY (missing)

Additional keys available but no corresponding providers:
- DEEPSEEK_API_KEY, FIREWORKS_API_KEY, TOGETHER_API_KEY, CEREBRAS_API_KEY, etc.

## Key Findings

### 1. Streaming Infrastructure Fixed
The recent fix to the streaming system resolved issues across multiple providers:
- Fixed Req library :into option handling
- Resolved pipeline state management for :streaming
- Benefits Groq, LM Studio, and other providers using shared streaming

### 2. Cost Tracking Working
All providers correctly calculate and report:
- Token usage (input/output/total)
- API costs based on provider pricing
- Request metadata and timing

### 3. Model Discovery
Excellent model discovery across providers:
- OpenRouter: 323 models (largest selection)
- OpenAI: 62 models (including latest o1 series)
- Gemini: 40 models (comprehensive Google AI)
- Anthropic: 5 models (focused, high-quality)
- Ollama: 7 local models (privacy-focused)

### 4. Provider Reliability
All tested providers show:
- Consistent response formats
- Proper error handling
- Good performance characteristics
- Full feature support (chat, streaming, model listing)

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**: Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini are fully ready
2. **For Cost-Effective Access**: OpenRouter provides excellent model variety
3. **For Privacy**: Ollama offers completely local inference
4. **For Development**: All tested providers work well for development and testing
