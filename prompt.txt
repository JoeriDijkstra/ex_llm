Complete the feature analysis by examining the Core, Infrastructure, and Testing directories. For each module found:

1. Identify what specific features/capabilities it provides
2. Determine its current architectural layer placement 
3. Assess whether it's properly integrated with the pipeline architecture or still using legacy patterns
4. Look for any overlapping functionality between modules
5. Identify the testing and caching system capabilities

Pay special attention to:
- The sophisticated test caching system mentioned in docs (25x speed improvement)
- Circuit breaker and telemetry infrastructure 
- Cost tracking and session management systems
- Context management strategies
- Any modules that might be duplicating functionality
