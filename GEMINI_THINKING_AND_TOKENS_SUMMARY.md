# Gemini Thinking Mode and countTokens API Investigation

## Summary

### 1. Thinking/Reasoning Models

**Available Model:** `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp`
- This model exists and works correctly
- It supports thinking/reasoning capabilities
- However, the thinking content is not returned separately in a `thinking_content` field
- Instead, the model includes its thinking process directly in the main response content

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Model responds successfully with `thinking_mode: true`
- ✅ Model shows step-by-step reasoning in response
- ❌ No separate `thinking_content` field in response structure
- ❌ The model is not listed in the standard `list_models()` API response

### 2. countTokens API Issue

**Problem:** The `count_tokens/2` function has a signature mismatch:
- Public API expects: `count_tokens(content, options)`
- Implementation provides: `count_tokens(messages, model, options)`

**Errors Found:**
1. When passing a string: "protocol Enumerable not implemented for type BitString"
2. When using request format: "key :model not found"

**Root Cause:** 
The function tries to map over the content parameter as if it were a list of messages, but when a string is passed, it fails because strings aren't enumerable in this context.

## Recommendations

### 1. For Thinking Mode Support

Add the thinking model to the known models list and document that thinking content is embedded in the main response:

```elixir
# In model configuration
%{
  id: "gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp",
  name: "Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (Experimental)",
  context_window: 1048576,
  capabilities: %{
    features: [:chat, :thinking],
    supports_streaming: true,
    supports_functions: true,
    supports_vision: true
  }
}
```

### 2. For countTokens API

The `count_tokens/2` function needs to be updated to handle different content types properly:

```elixir
def count_tokens(content, options \\ []) do
  model = Keyword.get(options, :model, "gemini-2.0-flash")
  
  # Convert content to proper format
  contents = case content do
    # String content
    content when is_binary(content) ->
      [%{role: "user", parts: [%{text: content}]}]
    
    # Already formatted messages
    messages when is_list(messages) ->
      Enum.map(messages, &convert_message_to_content/1)
    
    # Direct request format
    %{"contents" => _} = request ->
      # Pass through to count_tokens_with_request
      return count_tokens_with_request(request, options)
    
    # Other formats
    _ ->
      {:error, "Invalid content format"}
  end
  
  # ... rest of implementation
end
```

## Test Scripts Created

1. `debug_gemini_thinking.exs` - Lists available models and tests thinking capabilities
2. `test_gemini_thinking_detailed.exs` - Detailed test of thinking model responses
3. `test_count_tokens_fix.exs` - Demonstrates the countTokens API issues

## Next Steps

1. Update the Gemini provider to fix the `count_tokens/2` function signature
2. Add the thinking model to the known models configuration
3. Document that thinking content is embedded in the main response for Gemini
4. Add tests for both thinking mode and token counting functionality
