## Summary

Testing conducted on: 2025-06-30

### Working Providers (7/11)
- ✅ **OpenAI** - All features working, cost tracking enabled
- ✅ **Anthropic** - All features working, embeddings unavailable  
- ✅ **Groq** - Working (using deepseek-r1-distill model), vision unavailable
- ✅ **X.AI (Grok)** - Working with Grok-3 model, embeddings unavailable
- ✅ **OpenRouter** - Working with deepseek model
- ✅ **Ollama** - Local provider working
- ✅ **Mock** - Test provider working as expected

### Failed Providers (4/11)
- ❌ **Gemini** - Error: `:unexpected_pipeline_state`
- ❌ **Mistral** - Setup error: `key :name not found`
- ❌ **Perplexity** - Provider setup issue
- ❌ **LM Studio** - Connection/configuration issue

## Detailed Test Results

### Basic Chat Test
All working providers successfully completed the "2+2" calculation test with proper responses.

### Cost Tracking
- OpenAI: $0.000009 (26 tokens)
- Anthropic: $0.000103 (30 tokens)  
- X.AI: $0.000490 (42 tokens)
- OpenRouter: $0.000031 (26 tokens)
- Groq: No pricing data for deepseek-r1-distill model
- Ollama/Mock: No cost (local)

### Key Findings

1. **Streaming Timeout Fix**: The streaming timeout configuration fix from our debugging session is working correctly - no timeout issues observed during testing.

2. **Provider-Specific Issues**:
   - Gemini has a pipeline state error that needs investigation
   - Mistral provider has configuration/setup issues
   - Some providers like Groq are using newer models (deepseek-r1) that don't have pricing data

3. **Feature Availability**:
   - Vision is unavailable for Groq  
   - Embeddings are unavailable for Anthropic, X.AI, and OpenRouter
   - Cost tracking works for most cloud providers

## Recommendations

1. Investigate Gemini's `unexpected_pipeline_state` error - likely related to response parsing
2. Fix Mistral provider setup to handle missing `:name` key
3. Update pricing data for newer models like deepseek-r1-distill
4. Add proper error handling for provider configuration issues
