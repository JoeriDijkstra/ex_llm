### Issues Found

1. **Streaming**: High-level `ExLLM.stream/4` fails with pipeline error (same as LM Studio)
2. **Capabilities**: `get_provider_capability_summary/1` has case clause error
3. **Legacy Model**: mixtral-8x7b-32768 is decommissioned

### Conclusion

**Groq provider is fully functional for non-streaming operations.** All core features work:
- Chat completions ✅
- Model listing ✅  
- Multiple model support ✅
- Token usage tracking ✅
- Cost tracking ✅
- Provider configuration ✅

The streaming issue appears to be the same endpoint configuration problem as LM Studio, not a Groq-specific issue.
