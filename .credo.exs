        # - Mock adapter provider conversion
        # - ResponseCache mock configuration

        # - model_config.ex: YAML config keys (controlled, finite set)
        # - response_cache.ex: Cache JSON keys (controlled by our format)
        # - session.ex: Additional message fields (controlled by our API)
        # - capabilities.ex: Dynamic capability normalization
        # - model_capabilities.ex: Capability names from YAML
        # - xai.ex: Capability names from config
        # - http_client.ex: SSE fallback for unknown event types
        #
        # These are acceptable because:
        # 1. Config files are controlled by developers, not user input
        # 2. The atom table won't grow unbounded
